## 💡 What is This

This project extracts the core runtime ideas from [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and reorganizes them into a set of reusable Rust crates. It's not a line-by-line TypeScript translation — it's a clean-room redesign of the capabilities an agent truly depends on:

- **Message Loop** — driving multi-turn conversations
- **Tool Execution** — orchestrating tool calls with schema validation
- **Permission Control** — authorization before file/shell/network access
- **Long-running Tasks** — background execution with lifecycle management
- **Context Compaction** — keeping long sessions stable under token budgets
- **Model Providers** — unified interface for streaming LLM backends
- **MCP Integration** — extending capabilities via Model Context Protocol

Think of it as an **agent runtime skeleton**:

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Top** | A thin CLI that assembles all crates |
| **Middle** | Core runtime: message loop, tool orchestration, permissions, tasks, model abstraction |
| **Bottom** | Concrete implementations: built-in tools, MCP client, context management |

> If the boundaries are clean enough, this can serve not only Claude-style coding agents, but any agent system that needs a solid runtime foundation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+ ([install](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Model backend** — one of the following:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (recommended for local development)
  - Anthropic API key

### Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd rust-clw
cargo build
```

### Run with Ollama (local, no API key needed)

Make sure Ollama is running and has a model pulled:

```bash
# Pull a model (only needed once)
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b

# Single query
cargo run -- --provider ollama -m "qwen3.5:9b" -q "list files in the current directory"

# Interactive REPL
cargo run -- --provider ollama -m "qwen3.5:9b"
```

Any model with tool-calling support works. Larger models produce better tool-use results:

```bash
cargo run -- --provider ollama -m "qwen3.5:27b" -q "read Cargo.toml and summarize the workspace"
```

### Run with Anthropic API

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
cargo run -- -q "list files in the current directory"
```

### CLI Options

```text
Usage: claw-rs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -m, --model <MODEL>          Model name (default: auto per provider)
  -s, --system <SYSTEM>        System prompt
  -p, --permission <MODE>      Permission mode: auto, interactive, deny
  -q, --query <QUERY>          Single query (non-interactive), omit for REPL
      --provider <PROVIDER>    Provider: anthropic, ollama, openai, stub
      --ollama-url <URL>       Ollama server URL (default: http://localhost:11434)
      --max-turns <N>          Max turns per conversation (default: 100)
```

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Backend | How to activate |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `ollama` | Ollama (local) | `--provider ollama` or auto when no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic API | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var |
| `openai` | Any OpenAI-compatible API | `--provider openai` + `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `stub` | No real model (for testing) | `--provider stub` |

## 🤔 Why Rebuild in Rust

Claude Code has excellent engineering quality, but it's a **complete product**, not a reusable runtime library. UI, runtime, tool systems, and state management are deeply intertwined. Reading the source teaches a lot, but extracting parts for reuse is nontrivial.

This project aims to:

- **Decompose** tightly coupled logic into single-responsibility crates
- **Replace** runtime constraints with trait and enum boundaries
- **Transform** "only works inside this project" implementations into **reusable agent components**

## 🎯 Design Goals

1. **Runtime first, product later.** Prioritize solid foundations for Agent loop, Tool, Task, and Permission.
2. **Each crate should be self-explanatory.** Names reveal responsibility, interfaces reveal boundaries.
3. **Make replacement natural.** Tools, model providers, permission policies, and compaction strategies should all be swappable.
4. **Learn from Claude Code's experience** without replicating its UI or internal features.

### Crate Map

| Crate | Purpose | Derived From (Claude Code) |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| `clawcr-core` | Message model, state container, main loop, session | `query.ts`, `QueryEngine.ts`, `state/store.ts` |
| `clawcr-tools` | Tool trait, registry, execution orchestration, and built-in tools | `Tool.ts`, `tools.ts`, tool service layer |
| `clawcr-tasks` | Long task lifecycle and notification mechanism | `Task.ts`, `tasks.ts` |
| `clawcr-safety` | Secret redaction, approval policy, sandbox policy, and legacy runtime permission compatibility | `types/permissions.ts`, `utils/permissions/` |
| `clawcr-provider` | Unified model interface, streaming, retry | `services/api/` |
| `clawcr-core::context` | Context management, compaction, and token budget control | `services/compact/`, `query/tokenBudget.ts` |
| `clawcr-mcp` | MCP client, connection, discovery, reconnect | `services/mcp/` |
| `clawcr-cli` | Executable entry point, assembles all crates | CLI layer |

## 🔍 Crate Overview

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-core</b> — The foundation</summary>

Manages how a conversation turn starts, continues, and stops. Defines the unified message model, main loop, and session state. This is the bedrock of the entire system.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-tools</b> — Tools and dispatch</summary>

Defines tools, schedules them, and ships the built-in file, shell, search, and edit capabilities in one crate.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-tasks</b> — Background task runtime</summary>

Separating tool calls from runtime tasks is critical for supporting long commands, background agents, and completion notifications fed back into the conversation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-safety</b> — Safety and authorization layer</summary>

Controls what the agent can do, when it must ask the user, and when to refuse outright. Essential whenever agents read files, write files, or execute commands.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-provider</b> — Model abstraction</summary>

Shields the system from differences between model backends. Unifies streaming output, retry logic, and error recovery.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-core::context</b> — Context management</summary>

Ensures long session stability. Not just "summarization" — applies different compression levels and budget controls based on context to prevent unbounded growth.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-mcp</b> — MCP integration</summary>

Connects to external MCP services, bringing remote tools, resources, and prompts into the unified capability surface.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>clawcr-cli</b> — CLI entry point</summary>

Packages the executable as `claw-rs` and wires together the runtime crates for interactive and one-shot use.
</details>

### 1-Week Plan

- **Day 1**: Finalize crate boundaries and wire the minimal CLI

- **Day 3**: Stabilize provider flow, permissions, and session state
- **Day 4**: Add editing and search tools
- **Day 5**: Improve long-session handling with tasks and compaction
- **Day 6**: Start MCP and plugin/skill integration
