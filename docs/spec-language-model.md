# ClawCodeRust Detailed Specification: Language Model

## Background and Goals

The overview defines model configuration as a complete description of:

- Capabilities
- Constraints
- Behavior

This specification defines the model catalog, prompt assembly inputs, provider-facing request model, and fallback behavior required to implement that contract.

## Scope

In scope:

- Model catalog schema.
- Config loading and validation.
- Prompt assembly inputs.
- Context window, compaction, verbosity, reasoning, and truncation controls.
- Rust interfaces inside `clawcr-core` between model selection, prompt building, and provider adapters.

Out of scope:

- Provider transport details.
- Billing, account tiers, or UI model picker rendering.

## Reference Rationale

The overview defines the model contract and budget knobs but does not prescribe a tokenizer implementation. For local budgeting, the required baseline is a deterministic byte-heuristic estimator because it:

- is deterministic and cheap enough to run before every turn
- works without provider-specific tokenizer dependencies
- can be reconciled against actual post-response usage when providers report authoritative counts
- handles structured items, encoded reasoning, and inline images in a way that is stable across providers

## Module Responsibilities and Boundaries

`clawcr-core::model` owns:

- Model catalog loading.
- Capability lookup.
- Provider-specific request normalization.
- Fallback model resolution.

`clawcr-core` owns:

- Selecting a model for a turn.
- Passing prompt and tool definitions to the provider.
- Enforcing config-derived constraints during prompt construction.

## Model Catalog File Format

The overview requires a config JSON file containing an array of model configs.

Required path:

```text
~/.clawcr/models.json
```

Optional project override:

```text
<workspace>/.clawcr/models.json
```

Merge order:

1. Built-in defaults compiled into the binary
2. User-level file
3. Project-level file

Model `slug` is the merge key.

## Core Data Structures

```rust
pub struct ModelConfig {
    pub slug: String,
    pub display_name: String,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub default_reasoning_level: ReasoningLevel,
    pub supported_reasoning_levels: Vec<ReasoningLevel>,
    pub base_instructions: String,
    pub model_messages: Option<Vec<ModelMessageTemplate>>,
    pub shell_type: ShellToolType,
    pub apply_patch_tool_type: ApplyPatchToolType,
    pub web_search_tool_type: WebSearchToolType,
    pub supports_parallel_tool_calls: bool,
    pub supports_search_tool: bool,
    pub experimental_supported_tools: Vec<String>,
    pub support_verbosity: bool,
    pub default_verbosity: Verbosity,
    pub supports_reasoning_summaries: bool,
    pub default_reasoning_summary: ReasoningSummaryMode,
    pub context_window: u32,
    pub effective_context_window_percent: u8,
    pub auto_compact_token_limit: Option<u32>,
    pub truncation_policy: TruncationPolicyConfig,
    pub input_modalities: Vec<InputModality>,
    pub supports_image_detail_original: bool,
    pub visibility: ModelVisibility,
    pub supported_in_api: bool,
    pub priority: i32,
    pub availability_nux: Option<String>,
    pub upgrade: Option<String>,
    pub used_fallback_model_metadata: bool,
}
```

Enums must be explicit and closed:

- `ReasoningLevel = Low | Medium | High | XHigh`
- `Verbosity = Low | Medium | High`
- `InputModality = Text | Image`
- `ModelVisibility = Visible | Hidden | Experimental`

## Interface Definitions

```rust
pub trait ModelCatalog {
    fn list_visible(&self) -> Vec<&ModelConfig>;
    fn get(&self, slug: &str) -> Option<&ModelConfig>;
    fn resolve_for_turn(&self, requested: Option<&str>) -> Result<&ModelConfig, ModelConfigError>;
}
```

```rust
pub struct ResolvedTurnModel {
    pub config: ModelConfig,
    pub effective_compact_limit: u32,
    pub effective_input_budget: u32,
    pub tool_capabilities: ToolCapabilitySet,
}
```

Provider request interface additions:

```rust
pub struct ModelInvocation {
    pub model: String,
    pub system: PromptEnvelope,
    pub messages: Vec<RequestMessage>,
    pub tools: Vec<ToolDefinition>,
    pub settings: TurnModelSettings,
}
```

## Prompt Assembly

Prompt assembly inputs, in order:

1. Base instructions from `ModelConfig.base_instructions`
2. Optional structured `model_messages`
3. Safety constraint messages
4. Context summary items
5. Full recent conversation items
6. Current user input
7. Tool definitions

Requirements:

- Structured prompt sections must be deterministic.
- The same input history and model config must produce the same prompt envelope.
- Tool descriptions are included only when the model supports the requested tools.

## Context Window and Budget Computation

Effective input budget:

```text
effective_input_budget =
  floor(context_window * effective_context_window_percent / 100)
```

Auto-compact threshold:

- If `auto_compact_token_limit` is set, use it.
- Otherwise compute `floor(effective_input_budget * 0.90)`.

Token estimation baseline:

- Preflight token budgeting must use the shared context-management estimator defined in [spec-context-management.md](./spec-context-management.md).
- That estimator must operate on the normalized prompt-visible view, not raw stored history.
- It must estimate ordinary items from serialized model-visible bytes, apply special handling for encoded reasoning content, and replace inline image payload bytes with fixed or patch-derived image costs before converting bytes to tokens.
- If provider usage is returned after a successful response, future turn budgeting must treat that usage as the authoritative baseline and only re-estimate newly appended local prompt material.
- Model selection, auto-compaction, and output-headroom reservation must all use this same estimator contract so budgeting decisions are internally consistent.

Max output tokens:

- Turn settings may override default output cap.
- The provider layer must reject values that exceed provider hard limits.

## Truncation Policy

The model config owns item-level truncation behavior.

Required config shape:

```rust
pub struct TruncationPolicyConfig {
    pub default_max_chars: usize,
    pub tool_output_max_chars: usize,
    pub user_input_max_chars: usize,
    pub binary_placeholder: String,
    pub preserve_json_shape: bool,
}
```

Rules:

- Truncation happens before prompt serialization.
- Tool outputs use shape-preserving truncation when the content is JSON.
- Binary payloads are replaced with placeholder text and metadata.

## State Transitions and Lifecycle

Model resolution for a turn:

1. Load catalog.
2. Resolve requested slug or default highest-priority visible model.
3. Validate turn-level overrides.
4. Derive effective context budget and tool capability set.
5. Pass `ResolvedTurnModel` to prompt builder and provider.

Fallback behavior:

1. Provider error indicates unsupported model or routing failure.
2. Resolve fallback candidate by same provider family or configured upgrade target.
3. Record `used_fallback_model_metadata = true` in turn metadata.
4. Rebuild request if capabilities differ.

## Error Handling Strategy

`ModelConfigError` variants:

- `ModelNotFound`
- `InvalidCatalog`
- `UnsupportedTurnOverride`
- `ContextBudgetInvalid`
- `CapabilityMismatch`

`ProviderSelectionError` variants:

- `ProviderUnavailable`
- `FallbackUnavailable`
- `ProviderModelMismatch`

## Concurrency and Async Model

- Catalog loading may be cached behind `ArcSwap` or `RwLock`.
- Provider invocation remains async and streaming.
- Fallback resolution must occur inside the same turn without racing a second active provider call.

## Persistence, Caching, and IO

- Model catalog is loaded lazily at startup and file-watched only if hot reload is added later.
- Resolved model slug and fallback metadata are persisted in `TurnRecord`.
- Byte-estimate caches, including image-cost caches, may be in-memory only.

## Observability

Required fields in logs and metrics:

- `model_slug`
- `provider_name`
- `context_window`
- `effective_input_budget`
- `auto_compact_token_limit`
- `fallback_used`

Metrics:

- `provider.request.duration_ms`
- `provider.stream.first_token_ms`
- `provider.error.count`
- `provider.fallback.count`

## Security and Edge Cases

- Hidden models must not be exposed through public API listing unless explicitly allowed.
- Models that do not support images must receive image-stripped prompt material.
- A project-level catalog override must not silently remove required built-in models without a warning.

## Testing Strategy and Acceptance Criteria

Required tests:

- Catalog merge behavior.
- Context budget derivation.
- Fallback selection.
- Capability mismatch rejection.
- Prompt assembly ordering.

Acceptance criteria:

- A turn can resolve its model config without UI-specific state.
- Prompt assembly and token budgeting are deterministic and use the shared byte-heuristic estimator contract described in the context-management spec.
- Unsupported tool or modality combinations fail before a provider request is sent.

## Dependencies With Other Modules

- Conversation provides prompt-view items.
- Context Management provides summary and truncation inputs.
- Safety injects constraint instructions and redaction behavior.
- API exposes the model list and per-turn overrides.

## Open Questions and Assumptions

Assumptions:

- Model catalogs remain JSON for compatibility with the overview.
- `model_messages` is provider-neutral and interpreted by prompt assembly, not by provider adapters directly.

Open questions:

- Whether optional provider tokenizer plugins should be allowed as advisory diagnostics while keeping the byte-heuristic estimator as the required control path for compaction and preflight fitting.
- Whether `upgrade` should be only advisory metadata or an automatic fallback hint.
